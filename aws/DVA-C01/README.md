Elastic Beanstalk:
* Web (ec2 asg elb):
   * Load balanced env (ec2, elb, asg)
   * Single Instance env (ec2, asg (n=1))
* Worker (ec2 asg sns) env
* Deployment:
   * All at once: 
      * Fullredeployment for rollback
      * Cons: downtime
   * Rolling: 
      * Remove a part of existing servers
      * Create new servers
      * Rollback requires roll update   
   * Rolling with additional batch:
      * Create new few servers
      * Remove old
      * Pros: never reduce capacity
      * Rollback requires roll update 
   * Immutable: 
      * Create new servers+asg
      * Switch to a new asg 
      * Pros: safest for critical apps
   * Blue/green: 
      * Similar to Immutable
      * Uses dns to switch LB
      * Cons: slow switch

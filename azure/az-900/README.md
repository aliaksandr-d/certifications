# AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

## Understand cloud concepts (15-20%) 

### Describe the benefits and considerations of using cloud services
#### Understand terms such as high availability, scalability, elasticity, agility, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery
##### High Availability (HA)
The ability of the application to continue running in a healthy state, without significant downtime. By "healthy state," we mean the application is responsive, and users can connect to the application and interact with it. 

##### Scalability
Increase or decrease the resources and services used based on the demand or workload at any given time. Vertical Scaling (aka "scaling up) - add more resources to existing servers. Horizontal Scaling (aka "scaling out) - add more servers.

##### Vertical Scaling (aka "scaling up")
The process of adding resources to increase the power of an existing server (e.g. adding a faster CPU, additional CPUs, more memory).

##### Horizontal Scaling (aka "scaling out")
The process of adding more servers that function together as one unit (e.g. adding more servers).

##### Elasticity
Automatically add or remove resources based on demand.

##### Cloud Agility
Cloud agility is the ability to rapidly change an IT infrastructure in order to adapt to the evolving needs of the business (e.g. if your service peaks one month, you can scale to demand and pay a larger bill for the month. If the following month the demand drops, you can reduce the used resources and be charged less).

##### Fault Tolerance
Redundancy is often built into cloud services architecture so if one component fails, a backup component takes its place. This is referred to as fault tolerance and it ensures that your customers aren't impacted when an unexpected accident occurs.

##### Disaster Recovery
The ability to recover from rare but major incidents: non-transient, wide-scale failures, such as service disruption that affects an entire region. Disaster recovery includes data backup and archiving, and may include manual intervention, such as restoring a database from backup. 

#### Understand the principles of economies of scale
Economies of scale is the ability to do things more efficiently or at a lower-cost per unit when operating at a larger scale (e.g. the ability to acquire hardware at a lower cost than if a single user or smaller business were purchasing it, cloud providers can also make deals with local governments and utilities to get tax savings, lower pricing on power, cooling, and high-speed network connectivity between sites). 

#### Understand the differences between Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
##### Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
CapEx is the spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. CapEx is an upfront cost, which has a value that reduces over time.

##### Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
OpEx is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. There is no upfront cost, you pay for a service or product as you use it. 

#### Understand the consumption-based model

### Describe the differences between Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
#### Describe Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
Infrastructure as a Service is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you complete control over the hardware that runs your application (IT infrastructure servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, and operating systems). Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you rent it. It's an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet. 

#### Describe Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
PaaS provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications. The goal of PaaS is to help you create an application quickly without managing the underlying infrastructure. For example, when deploying a web application using PaaS, you don't have to install an operating system, web server, or even system updates. PaaS is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud. 

#### Describe Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
SaaS is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer. It is usually based on an architecture where one version of the application is used for all customers, and licensed through a monthly or annual subscription. Office 365, Skype, and Dynamics CRM Online are perfect examples of SaaS software. 

#### Compare and contrast the three different service type
|      | User | Cloud |
|------|------|-------|
| IaaS | Purchase, installation, configuration, and management of their own software operating systems, middleware, and applications. | Responsible for ensuring that the underlying cloud infrastructure (such,as virtual machines, storage, and networking) is available for the user. |
| PaaS | Responsible for the development of their own applications. | Responsible for operating system management, and network and service configuration. |
| SaaS | Users just use the application software; they are not responsible for any maintenance or management of that software. | The cloud provider is responsible for the provision, management, and maintenance of the application software. |
